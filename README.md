###Problem Statement

The estimation of the remaining useful life (RUL) of engine air filters in the mining industry is a significant concern. Air filters are used to prevent harmful dust particles from entering the engine components. However, over time, the filter becomes contaminated, leading to increased air flow restriction.

The restriction in airflow can be quantified by measuring the pressure inside the engine component. For heavy vehicles like mining trucks, it is assumed that the filter becomes significantly plugged when the pressure reaches 7.5 KPA, indicating the need for a filter change.

In the current scenario, operators are unable to accurately determine the remaining life of the filter, resulting in unplanned shutdowns that last for 7-10 working days while a complete filter replacement takes place.

Our proposed approach aims to solve this problem by predicting the remaining useful life of the filter. The method involves identifying the point of filter plugging and then estimating the RUL based on the rate of KPA increment. By monitoring the rate of pressure increase, we can provide operators with early warnings and proactive maintenance recommendations to avoid unexpected shutdowns and minimize downtime.

##Objective of Remaining Useful Life:

Null Hypothesis: There is no correlation between the air-filter differential pressure and the operating time of the truck. The rate of increment of KPA does not affect RUL prediction.

Alternative Hypothesis: There is a linear correlation between the air-filter differential pressure and the operating time of the truck.

##Solution:

Analyze the behavior of the data using statistical modeling techniques.

Extract the cycles from the data using mathematical equations or pattern recognition algorithms.

Determine the rate of increment in the differential pressure based on time using a linear model or other regression techniques.

Apply the mathematical equation or regression model to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the filters.

##Proposed Solution:

Estimate the time to failure of the four differential air filters.

Estimate the time remaining for the air-filter differential pressure to reach 7.5 KPA.

Generate an alert when the estimated RUL to reach 7.5 KPA is less than 100 hours.

Send an alert when there is abnormal behavior in the inner left, inner right, outer left, or outer right differential pressure, such as sudden and continuous spikes or drops, no data, false filter change behavior, or no trend in data after 1000 truck operating hours.

##Solution Architecture:

Collect data from the PI Server or other data sources.

Detect cycle changes in the data using algorithms or mathematical equations.

Estimate the RUL using appropriate modeling techniques.

Implement a monitoring system to generate alerts based on RUL predictions and abnormal behavior detection.

Deploy the solution in the mining industry to continuously monitor air-filter health and provide timely maintenance recommendations to avoid unplanned shutdowns.
